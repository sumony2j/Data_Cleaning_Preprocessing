# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing in Python

## Introduction

Data cleaning and preprocessing are essential steps in any data analysis or machine learning project. This repository provides examples and tutorials on how to perform data cleaning and preprocessing using Python.

## What is Data Cleaning?

Data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in a dataset to improve its quality and accuracy. It involves various tasks such as:

- Handling missing data
- Removing duplicates
- Correcting erroneous values
- Standardizing data formats
- Dealing with outliers

## What is Data Preprocessing?

Data preprocessing involves transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis or modeling. It includes tasks such as:

- Feature scaling
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature extraction
- Dimensionality reduction
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

## Tools and Libraries Used

In this repository, we use the following Python libraries for data cleaning and preprocessing:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing and array operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and preprocessing techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with examples and tutorials on various data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
- **Data**: Sample datasets used in the examples.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/data-cleaning-preprocessing.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Navigate to the `Notebooks` directory and run the Jupyter notebooks to explore different data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
